0.4.0
* Added Guild Bank functionality
  Guild bank contents and transaction logs are now available.
  Accessing them requires that you login, which returns a cookie string which must be used for all subsequent requests.

  api = Wowr::API.new(:guild_name => 'my_guild', :realm => 'my_realm')
  cookie = api.login('myuser', 'mypass')
  api.get_guild_bank_contents(cookie)
  api.get_guild_bank_log(cookie)
  
  It's possible to specify the guild and usual extra parameters
  api.get_guild_bank_contents(cookie, "my_other_guild", :realm => 'other_realm)
  
  At no point are your user details stored and SSH is used for connections to the server.
  Thanks to Hesperus and SheepCow of Rawr for help with this.

* Buy and sell prices, as well as transactions in the guild bank now use Wowr::Classes::Money
