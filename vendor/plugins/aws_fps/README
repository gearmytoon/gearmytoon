WARNING -----------------------------------------------------------------------

This plugin is not yet recommended for production use.  You're looking at a
very early release that should be considered either a sample implementation,
or a 'starter kit' for building a robust implementation of Amazon's FPS payment
service.

As such, you are STRONGLY encouraged to review the code within this plugin
before using it in any manner whatsoever.  If you find a bug, please report it
to the author, or better yet, write and submit a patch for the good of the
community.


DESCRIPTION -------------------------------------------------------------------

Provides methods for interfacing with Amazon's Flexible Payments Service (FPS).

Executing a successful Amazon FPS payment requres three tokens:
	- Caller token (your web application)
	- Sender token (person sending the payment)
	- Receiver token (person receiving the payment - you, or a third party)

This plugin allows you to generate caller and sender tokens via the FPS API
in addition to preparing a request for a receiver token using Amazon's
FPS Pipeline (a.k.a., CBUI/Co-Branded User Interface).  The plugin also
provides a method for executing a payment via the Query module.

Implementation of this plug-in is controller-heavy.  As such, a sample
controller with accompanying views is provided in the example/ folder.  To
see these examples in action, copy the contents of this folder to your
RAILS_ROOT/app folder, being careful not to overwrite your existing controllers
and views.  Once you're ready, browse to: http://localhost:3000/payment/


IMPLEMENTATION ----------------------------------------------------------------

1) Set up config/amazon_fps.yml.

After installing this plugin, you must first place a file called amazon_fps.yml
in your applications config directory (located at RAILS_ROOT/config).  See the
sample file located in examples/amazon_fps.yml.


2) Implement a payment controller.

Next, set up a controller to handle checkout and payment processing.  For an
example, see example/controllers/payment_controller.rb.  This example shows
how to generate tokens that can be used to process a recurring monthly
subscription.  Note that while a recurring subscription authorizes recurring
monthly transactions, you must process subsequent transactions yourself.

3) Implement the appropriate views.

Along with your controller actions come views.  This is up to you as well, but
is not difficult.  See the example views provided in example/views/ for more
information.
