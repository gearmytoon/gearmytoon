TODO:
- implement the stat standardized dps units for each class - when you ask a item for dps you will pass in it's multiplier object
- expand the maxdps.com import to cover all classes - we just use this to initially seed good items, maybe there is a better way to seed items?
- map wowarmory magic numbers, quality, inventory type, etc into meaningful names, ie quality = 4 should be quality = 'epic'
- find a way to identify items that drop from heroics/raids etc, there is likely a item source attribute you can backtrace.
- consider gems slots and gem bonus upgrades when comparing items
- do the item sources properly, there are two source types: vendor and drop



- add local to the search, i.e. support euro and oceanic servers.

- show item cost in badges on the character show page
- populate real data by character name/realm on a class basis
- find real recommendations for frost badges
- find real recommendations for triumph badges
- find real recommendations for heroics
- run real forumla's for classes - start with hunter - STARTED
- take racials into account
- take trinkets cooldown effects into account *** ie 1024 attack power for 20 seconds with a 2 min cooldown = (1024 * (20/120)) * attack_power_multiplier
