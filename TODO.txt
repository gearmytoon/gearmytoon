TODO:
- change the import process to build a list of items we care about from max dps and have a seperate task to refresh/build the list from wowarmory
- add weapon upgrade support
- add specific dps multipliers based on class spec's
- add class specific armor types (ie some mail is only usable by hunters)
- add faction to character and item
- Import these dungeons: 206,4120,3477,4494,4196,4415,4375,4264,1196,4272,4228,4809,4813,4820,4723,4100
- Import these raids: 4603,4273,4493,4500,2159,3456,4812,4722

- import all items for all classes
- implement the stat standardized dps units for each class - when you ask a item for dps you will pass in it's multiplier object
- change multipliers based on spec (ie 15% more agility or 100% attack power from intellect, etc)
- add in hard caps for multipliers
- map wowarmory magic numbers, quality, inventory type, etc into meaningful names, ie quality = 4 should be quality = 'epic'
- consider gems slots and gem bonus upgrades when comparing items

- add local to the search, i.e. support euro and oceanic servers.

- take racials into account
- take trinkets cooldown effects into account *** ie 1024 attack power for 20 seconds with a 2 min cooldown = (1024 * (20/120)) * attack_power_multiplier
